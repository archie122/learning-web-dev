What is web design?

 It is easy to make a website, however, it is harder to make a memorable website. There are a multitude of ways of making a website memorable, which involve colour theory, UX design, contact, layout, and other things.

Typography
 There are two major find families to know:
 - The Serif family, which have little feet at the bottom of some of their character. Which makes your design look more serious and professional.
 - The Sans family, which makes your design look more Simple, sensible, and straightforward.
 - The Script family, which makes your design look more personal, elegant and casual.
 - The Display family, which makes your design look more friendly, loud or amusing.
 - The Modern family, which makes your design look more stylish and chic.

 Generally speaking, it is better to actually choose two different types of fonts for anything you are doing.

 
UI design
 UI design is the process of designing a website or application to be visually appealing. In other words, it's the process of getting the users attention, and in the intended way that you want. 

 The type of colour that is actually use on. The website has a great effect on understanding and holding the users attention. If the right types of colours are used, they are able to match the content on the website and effectively communicate what the website's purpose is.

 One of the biggest ways that a website layout can affect the user experience is through how much content is displayed. If the content is too wide, then the user will have a hard time reading, and understanding what the website. However, if the contact is displayed with Too $hort the user will also have a difficult time reading.

 Alignment also affects the user experience. If the Contin that is being displayed is not properly aligned creates a bit of a jar and experience with a user to constantly have to go back-and-forth to understand what they are looking at.

 White space is also important. If there is too much white space present in the website, it again becomes a bit jarring for the user to read. However, if the white space is appropriate to use, it makes the website more interesting to read.

 Another thing that is incredibly important is the context of audience. If the website is properly designed for the appropriate audience, it will have a greater impact on the user, and will allow for the user to make the intended steps.

UX 
 User experience is just as important as the design of a website, however, no matter how perfectly you might try to design a website it all comes down to how the user chooses to use the website in their own way. Should result in a user using a website, not for its intended purposes. User experience is supposed to be as unobtrusive as possible and allow the user to accomplish whatever task they're trying to do as easily as possible

 Simplicity is a key aspect of user experience. If the website looks very bloated with information, the website is complex and difficult to navigate. However, if the website is simply laid out and easy to understand, the user, will have an easier time interacting with the website.

 Consistency allows for a user to have an easier time navigating a set of websites that have consistent design. If you run multiple different websites, it would be better if you made all of the websites consistent with design and easy to understand because the user would be able to use their previous knowledge to navigate the website.

 Reading patterns, also allow for the user to easily interact with the website. Thus it is recommended to use the f layout Which relies on the idea of keeping the most important information as easily accessible to the left-hand side of the website. Or using the Z layout, which uses the idea of keeping information at the top and at the bottom of the website. 

 The final idea in creating good use experience is understanding that the website needs to work for all platforms. Whether it's on a large screen on a tablet or on smartphone, website needs to not only work on all these platforms. It needs to look good on all these platforms.

 Dark patterns are a nefarious way of designing a website to get the user to do the specific task that the company deems to be most profitable to them

What is HTML?

While you can't make a website using just CSS or just JS, you can't create a website using just HTML. That is what was using in the early years of web dev. HTML is responsible for defining the structure and the content of the website. 

Hyper Text : The abilty to link to other documents on the website
Markup Language: A set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text and images. This is mainly done through tags.

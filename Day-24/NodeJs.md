Why use Framework?
 Frameworks are a collection of tools that I have been developed for the purpose of simplifying back end development. So it makes more sense to use frameworks instead of having to develop a whole application from scratch. 

What is Node.js?
 It is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime application. That has the ability to be very scalable for network applications. In other words, Node.js basically takes JavaScript out of its application soley built for the web, to A programming language that can be used to develop web applications. The asynchronous part of the definition refers to Node.js being able to process requests asynchronously, when an event occurs. 

Why Node.js?
 Because Node.js uses JavaScript as its main programming language, it is very easy for a developer to work both on the front end, and the back end while using the same programming language. It is also scalable and can handle large amounts of data. It is very fast and non-blocking (which means that it can handle multiple requests at once). And has a large number of libraries that can be used to make the development process easier.

Node REPL
 Which stands for "Node Read Eval Print Loop", it is an environment where the user actually inputs, and the information is red, and evaluate it by the computer, and returned to the user. 

What are Native Modules?
 Native modules are modules that are built into the Node.js runtime environment. They are not a part of the core Node.js code but they provide additional functionality.

What is NPM?
 It stands for "Node Package Manager", it is a package manager for Node.js. It is used to install and manage packages.

ECMAScript Modules
 It is set of standardized JavaScript modules that can be used to create reusable code, and consistant code.

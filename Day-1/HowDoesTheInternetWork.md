What is the Internet? 

In the simplest of terms, the internet is akin to a wire that connect multiple computers together. This wire is responsible to getting data from one location to another.

When you go to a website, you are sending a request to a another computer called a server that is resposible for serving the files (which is the data) that you are requesting. The computer that actually sends the request is called a client. 

What happen when you go to a website from your computer? 

When you search up a website, you are actually sending a request to the ISP (Internet Service Provider). The ISP then sends that request to a DNS Server (Domain Name System). This is basically a massive database that looks for the IP Address the the client is requesting. The IP Address is a code that every computer has and allows for one computer to be connected to another. Once the specfic IP Address is found, it is sent directly to the ISP and then to the client. This process results in you being able to directly send requests to the spefic server and get the data that you want. 

Go to nslookup.io to look at the IP Address of any website. 

How does this relate to the sea?

To both receive and send data all over the world, there are massive cables that transfer data, incredibly quickly.

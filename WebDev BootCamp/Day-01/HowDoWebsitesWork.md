Based on the principles on how the internet work, the data that is sent across consists of three major files. These files being HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) : This file is responsible for the content that makes up a website. For example, text, buttons, links or images. 

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This file is responsible for the style of the website. This includes, the color of the background, the roundness or the size of the images. 

Javascript : This file give the website functionality. This includes being able to watch videos, send emails, or access you bank account. 

Combining all the concepts together, we can understand that a browser (an application that deals with these files and actually uses them) is able to see the content from the HTML, then using the CSS, the website looks in the intented way, and finally JS actually allows you to use the website for its intended purpose.  

Quick Fact : When you edit the specific HTML file of a website to say whatever you want it to, You are able to do this without permanently, changing the contents of the website because whenever you search anything on the browser, the files that are specifically being sent by the server are stored locally on your machine. And when you hit refresh, those files are sent again, and the local version ofThe file that you edited is discarded.
